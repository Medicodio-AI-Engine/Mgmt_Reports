- Rollback: Nothing to roll back: this issue is proposal-only, so no repository state is changed.

**Steps**

1. Enumerate every affected file and confirm the change is deterministic per file.
2. Confirm the transformation is reversible and produces no behavior change.
3. Apply the transformation in reviewable slices, each independently buildable.
4. Run build, typecheck, and the affected test suites per slice.
5. Record the file list, commands, and results for each slice.

**Stop conditions**

- SECURITY_SCOPE_UNVERIFIED: a human must confirm the surface is not security-sensitive
- OUT_OF_PILOT_SCOPE: widening the pilot is a human decision
- MISSING_CAPABILITY: repo.multi_file_edit: Dry-run pilot performs no writes to engineering repositories.
- MISSING_CAPABILITY: git.stacked_branches: Dry-run pilot creates no branches, commits, or pull requests.
- MISSING_CAPABILITY: ci.run_targeted_tests: No engineering repository is checked out or allowlisted in the pilot.
- The transformation requires human judgment on any file.
- Any slice changes runtime behavior.
- The migration touches database schema, data, or irreversible infrastructure.
