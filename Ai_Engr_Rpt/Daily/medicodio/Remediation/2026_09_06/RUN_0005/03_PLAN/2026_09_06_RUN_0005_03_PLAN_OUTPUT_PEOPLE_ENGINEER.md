- Repository: globalcodio-monorepo
- Autonomy tier: **D** (no execution)
- Proposed action: DOCUMENT ONLY: human-owned surface; produce findings and a proposal.
- Rollback: Nothing to roll back: this issue is proposal-only, so no repository state is changed.

**Steps**

1. Restate the reported pattern with its evidence and frequency.
2. Identify whether the remedy is process, tooling, or code.
3. Describe the smallest concrete improvement and who owns it.
4. Produce the proposal for human decision; make no repository change.

**Stop conditions**
