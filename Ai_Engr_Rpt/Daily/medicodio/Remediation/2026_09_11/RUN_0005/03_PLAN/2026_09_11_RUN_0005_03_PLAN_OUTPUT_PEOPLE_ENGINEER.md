- Repository: globalcodio-monorepo
- Autonomy tier: **D** (no execution)
- Proposed action: DOCUMENT ONLY: human-owned surface; produce findings and a proposal.

**Steps**

1. Derive QA cases from the issue, the diff, and the acceptance criteria.
2. State explicitly which cases can and cannot be executed with available access.
3. Execute the executable cases and record inputs, outputs, and environment.
4. Classify every failure as code defect, test defect, environment, data, or configuration.
5. Report unexecuted cases as NOT_RUN rather than assuming a pass.

**Stop conditions**
