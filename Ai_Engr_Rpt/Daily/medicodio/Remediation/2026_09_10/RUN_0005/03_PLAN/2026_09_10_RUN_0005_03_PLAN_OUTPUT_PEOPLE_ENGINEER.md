# Plan — proposed actions and stop conditions

**Run:** `RUN_0005` · **Report date:** 2026-09-10 · **Stage:** `03_PLAN` · **Status:** OK

> **Dry run.** No repository was modified, no commit or pull request was created, nothing was deployed, and no external system was changed. Everything below is analysis and proposal.

## `ISSUE_000282` Hand-written `docs(review)` gate/verdict logs

- Repository: globalcodio-monorepo
- Autonomy tier: **D** (no execution)
- Proposed action: DOCUMENT ONLY: human-owned surface; produce findings and a proposal.
- Rollback: Nothing to roll back: this issue is proposal-only, so no repository state is changed.

**Steps**

1. Derive QA cases from the issue, the diff, and the acceptance criteria.
2. State explicitly which cases can and cannot be executed with available access.
3. Execute the executable cases and record inputs, outputs, and environment.
4. Classify every failure as code defect, test defect, environment, data, or configuration.
5. Report unexecuted cases as NOT_RUN rather than assuming a pass.

**Stop conditions**

- OUT_OF_PILOT_SCOPE: widening the pilot is a human decision
- MISSING_CAPABILITY: qa.execute_cases: No QA environment or credentials are provisioned for the pilot.
- MISSING_CAPABILITY: ci.run_targeted_tests: No engineering repository is checked out or allowlisted in the pilot.
- Required test environment or credentials are unavailable.
- Validation would require production or PHI access.
