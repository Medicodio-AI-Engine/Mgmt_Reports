**Run:** `RUN_0003` · **Report date:** 2026-08-25 · **Stage:** `03_PLAN` · **Status:** OK

> **Dry run.** No repository was modified, no commit or pull request was created, nothing was deployed, and no external system was changed. Everything below is analysis and proposal.

## `ISSUE_000130` Low automation-adoption signal for svh-medicodio

- Repository: unresolved
- Autonomy tier: **C** (no execution)
- Proposed action: INVESTIGATE AND PROPOSE: no implementation until a human approves.
- Rollback: Nothing to roll back: this issue is proposal-only, so no repository state is changed.

**Steps**

1. Restate the reported pattern with its evidence and frequency.
2. Identify whether the remedy is process, tooling, or code.
3. Describe the smallest concrete improvement and who owns it.
4. Produce the proposal for human decision; make no repository change.

**Stop conditions**

- INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE: rating data cannot justify a change
- TARGET_UNRESOLVED: confirm the repository before any implementation
- The item requires an organizational policy decision.

## `ISSUE_000131` Building one more report against the same catalog/controller/service/repository shape

- Repository: globalcodio-monorepo
- Autonomy tier: **D** (no execution)
- Proposed action: DOCUMENT ONLY: human-owned surface; produce findings and a proposal.

1. Derive QA cases from the issue, the diff, and the acceptance criteria.
2. State explicitly which cases can and cannot be executed with available access.
3. Execute the executable cases and record inputs, outputs, and environment.
4. Classify every failure as code defect, test defect, environment, data, or configuration.
5. Report unexecuted cases as NOT_RUN rather than assuming a pass.

**Stop conditions**

2. Locate the existing test suite and the closest existing tests for that surface.
3. Write the smallest test that fails against the current behavior when the defect is present.
